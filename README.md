Will be using NLP and Machine Learning on travel.statsexchange.com data

In this project, there is NLP and machine learning on post data from stackexchange's travel subdomain.

The data is compressed into the .7z file format to save space. There are 6 .csv files and one readme file that contains some information on the fields.

posts_train.csv
comments_train.csv

badges.csv
votes_train.csv
tags.csv
readme.txt

This data came from and to get more data from other stackexchange subdomains, see here:
